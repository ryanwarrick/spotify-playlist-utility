# Spotify-Playlist-Utility

Python utility to archive, restore, & shuffle Spotify playlists.

Spotify's service has a few downsides. Fortunately, they offer a fairly nice Web API. To fill in these feature gaps, I developed a Python cmd line utility which offers the following features:
* Export: Spotify Saved (Liked) Tracks -> CSV track listing
* Export: Spotify Playlist -> CSV track listing
* Import: CSV track listing -> Spotify Playlist
* List: Spotify Playlists (name & track count)

## Project Context:

Long ago, I informally self-taught myself Python in a mostly hobby capacity. As my cybersecurity/IT career has progressed, I've worked to formalize my Python skills so that I can write compliant, well-documented, open-source, and packaged/deployable Python projects.

I used this project idea as an opportunity to build out a full-fledged Python project repo.
For example, this project...
* is packagable (can create distributable installer)
* has sphinx auto-generated docs to document classes/functions
* includes .vscode configs for easy development
* config file support
* command line arguments
* ...and more.
